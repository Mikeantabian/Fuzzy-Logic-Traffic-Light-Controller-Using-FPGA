# Traffic Light Controller using Fuzzy Logic

This project simulates the control of traffic lights at a four-way intersection using Fuzzy Logic. The controller makes decisions on green light durations based on traffic densities in each lane. The system dynamically adjusts the timings to optimize traffic flow and minimize waiting times, aiming to improve traffic management efficiency.
